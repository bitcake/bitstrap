# BitStrap

BitStrap is [BitCake](http://bitcakestudio.com/)'s collection of Unity tools that improve our workflow.

We use it across several projects and hope it will be of help for yours! :)

## What is this project for?

This is our humble way to give back to the gamedev community.
We hope this will ease other people lives when working with Unity.

You are free to use these tools in whatever project you're doing. Make us proud! :D

## Common Use Cases

If you're unsure of how can BitStrap help you, here's a list of common use cases where BitStrap shines!

[List of common use cases](../../wiki/Common-Use-Cases)

## Getting started

```
https://github.com/bitcake/bitstrap.git#upm
```
Currently BitStrap has been tested on Unity:
* 2020.3 LTS
* 2021.3 LTS

## Documentation

NOTE: Right now we're moving all the documentation to this repository [Wiki](https://github.com/bitcake/bitstrap/wiki)!

Although the classes are already documented, we also have a simple web page
containing a feature list followed by a quick explanation of each. You can think
of it as a "table of contents".
